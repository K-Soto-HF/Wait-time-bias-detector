# Wait-time-bias-detector
Human factors–driven Chrome extension that detects time-perception bias in theme park wait language using explainable cognitive models and live operational data.

##This project implements a human factors–based decision-support system that detects time-perception bias in natural language. Using theme park wait times as a safe operational analog, the extension identifies emotionally biased language, estimates perceived versus actual delay, and presents explainable feedback directly in the browser.

###All modeling, analysis, and UI logic are implemented in a single JavaScript file to emphasize clarity, traceability, and human-centered system design. Model is in early testing phase.
